# #e3 Summaries - Planning and Strategy

## Manual Capture Prompt
- **Prompt**: "Condense this detailed description into a succinct summary, retaining the main facts and key details, and omitting unnecessary elaboration to create a compact overview."
- **Process**: After a #e3 chat, the condensed summary will be provided in the format below. Copy the summary and paste it into this file.
- **Format**:
  - **Date**: [Date]
  - **Summary [X]**: [Summary text] (Add a number, e.g., "Summary 1", if multiple summaries exist for the same date)
  - **Follow-Up**: [Actions taken or outcomes, to be updated later]
  - **State**: [WIP, Completed, Short Term, Longer Term, or combo e.g., Short Term, DT]

## Summaries
- **Date**: March 21, 2025
- **Summary 1**: Plan to automate Git processes for future projects to streamline setup (not now, but soon). Noted uncertainty about `setup_project.py` in the `4feaA9I` commit; suggested checking with `git show`. Proposed creating a mini chat state for #e1–#e5 to track debugging (#e1) in real time, summarizing key points with “My Thoughts,” and condensing using a custom prompt for #e1 chats. Suggested storing condensed #e1 summaries in `state.json` or a development log to retain critical project impacts. Emphasized keeping the approach simple, modular, and action-based, aiming to reset to `4feaA9I` and start a standalone `TestProject` next.
- **Follow-Up**:
- **State**: Longer Term

- **Date**: March 21, 2025
- **Summary 2**: Suggested semi-automating #e3 capture by providing a condensed summary at the end of each #e3 chat, which can be copied and pasted into `e3_summaries.md`. Added the manual capture prompt to `e3_summaries.md` to document the process. Plan to improve automation later.
- **Follow-Up**:
- **State**: Short Term

- **Date**: March 26, 2025
- **Summary 1**: Completed a memory gap fix for `"state"` and `"history"` in `gro_Grok_Template`, addressing potential duplicate summaries or syncing issues. Planned a test to verify the fix. Expanded `state.json` from March 17 to March 26, focusing on the no-API, modular design and live testing process.
- **Follow-Up**:
- **State**: Completed, Short Term

- **Date**: March 26, 2025
- **Summary 2**: Reviewed `e3_summaries.md` to improve `#e3` capture. Noted gaps in the manual process, including missing recent `#e3` chats. Planned to add missing summaries and explore automation to streamline `#e3` capture.
- **Follow-Up**:
- **State**: WIP, Short Term, DT

- **Date**: March 26, 2025
- **Summary 3**: Reflected on updating the `#e3` summary format with a “State” field. Suggested improving `#DT` summaries by including more context to aid long-term memory, proposing a `#DTend` marker to delineate `#DT` sections. For `#DT`, planned a future `#e3` system within the `#e1`–`#e5` framework, designing a sub-simple modular neural network to analyze inputs, prioritize based on weights, and suggest actions, to be captured in a new `#e3` module (not yet created), while keeping current `#e3` tracking simple with states like WIP, Completed, Short Term, Longer Term.
- **Follow-Up**:
- **State**: WIP, Short Term, DT

## Future Vision (#DT - Deep Thought)
- **Date**: 2025-03-26
- **Goal 2**: Explore adding a logging module to track all #e1–#e5 inputs in real time, using a lightweight database like SQLite.
- **Purpose**: [To be defined]
- **State**: Longer Term, DT


- **Date**: 2025-03-26
- **Goal 1**: Explore adding a logging module to track all #e1–#e5 inputs in real time, using a lightweight database like SQLite.
- **Purpose**: [To be defined]
- **State**: Longer Term, DT


- **Date**: March 26, 2025
- **Goal 1**: Create a #e3 system within the #e1–#e5 framework, designing a sub-simple modular neural network for #e3 capture. Collaborate with Grok, using #e1–#e5 weights and design, to build a dedicated #e3 module.
- **Purpose**: Enhance #e3 reflections by analyzing patterns in #e1–#e5 inputs, prioritizing based on weights, and suggesting actions.
- **State**: Longer Term, DT- **Date**: 2025-03-26
- **Summary 2**: Processed #e3 input: #e3 "Test automation for e3 capture. Planning to improve logging.". For #DT, planned: Explore adding a logging module to track all #e1–#e5 inputs in real time, using a lightweight database like SQLite..
- **Follow-Up**:
- **State**: WIP, Short Term, DT

- **Date**: 2025-03-26
- **Summary 4**: Processed #e3 input: #e3 "Test automation for e3 capture. Planning to improve logging.". For #DT, planned: Explore adding a logging module to track all #e1–#e5 inputs in real time, using a lightweight database like SQLite..
- **Follow-Up**:
- **State**: WIP, Short Term, DT
